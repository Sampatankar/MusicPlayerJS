10/20: HTML5 Audio API - 20 VanillaJS Projects

This app is an aesthetically pleasing UI to play stored music through the HTML5 Audio API.

The app has a spinning image and song detail popup during playback.  We have play and pause functionality, the ability to switch songs and a progress bar.

This is the 10th project in Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript course on Udemy.com.

I am working through this project to revise concepts from B.Traversy's Modern JavaScript course, which I completed, and then to practice refactoring code using the React framework.
